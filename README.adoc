= Spring Demos
:toc:

== Rationale

This project aims to show both problems and interesting solutions I faced with the Spring ecosystem.

== Getting Started

=== Build

[source,bash]
----
mvn clean install
----


=== Running the application locally

To locally run the application, use the following command:

[source,bash]
----
mvn spring-boot:run
----

The application starts on port 9000, the actuator endpoints are available under port 9010.

For local tests, a mockserver (simulating a backend-service) and a zipkin server can be started with the provided docker-compose file.

[source,bash]
----
docker-compose -f ./tooling/docker-compose.yaml up
----

The mockserver can be reached via http://localhost:9030 and exposes a dashboard to monitor all requests is available via http://localhost:9030/mockserver/dashboard[Mockserver Dashboard].

The zipkin server can be reached via http://localhost:9040/zipkin.

Some example requests are available link:./tooling/requests.http[here].
